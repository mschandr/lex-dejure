# Lex-DeJure

**Lex-DeJure** is a secure, modular arbitration engine designed for seamless integration into existing systems. It enables fair, anonymous, quorum-based dispute resolution through a configurable API-first backend. Built for privacy, integrity, and extensibility, Lex-DeJure brings lawful decision-making into any application — without reinventing the gavel.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Secure Judge Anonymity** – Votes are stored privately and cannot be traced back to individual judges.
- 🧩 **Drop-in Integration** – Reference external user systems via hashed identifiers; no user data is copied or stored.
- ⚖️ **Customizable Quorums** – Define how many judges are required to reach a decision.
- 🗳 **Configurable Voting Options** – Use predefined or one-off vote options per arbitration.
- 🕒 **Deadline Handling** – Supports time-based arbitration phases, early resolution, and unresponsive judge replacement.
- 📈 **Observability Dashboard** – Stats on time-to-resolution, active judges, and volume trends.
- 🚨 **Anomaly Detection** – Prevent vote overflows and detect suspicious voting patterns.
- 🧪 **Sandbox Mode** – Seedable test arbitrations for QA and CI pipelines.
- ✉️ **External Email Support** – Secure notifications using your own mail server.
